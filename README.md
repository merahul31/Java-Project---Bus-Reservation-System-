# Java-Project---Bus-Reservation-System-

This is a Java Swing project created by me with a contribution of 50%. This was created in Java language using the NetBeans IDE platform. I have used XAMPP as a SQL database server.
In this, the user can book a seat on the bus where he/she wants to travel. The Admin can Add, Edit, or Remove a bus and many more.

## Getting Started

- Download the zip file of the repository.
- Open the code files into NetBeans or VSCode IDE.
- create a new database on Xampp server and import the provided SQL file.
- You are ready.
- Run Welcome.java file
